# Coding-Quiz-Challnge-4

Reason

The purpose behind this project was to demonstrate my javascript skills. This Project contians mostly JS files with moinor CSS and HTMl elements. Once you click the start quiz button you will have only 60 seconds to complete the quiz. The user has to answer 5 questions within the time limit, the penalty for incorrect answers is a 5 second deduction to the time that you have to complete the quiz. When correct answers are selected the user will get an alert stating they have made a correct choice. The same goes for if the user selects an incorrect answer. When th quiz is over the user will be presented with the final score and a prompt to enter in the user's initials. Then the score is logged into the Highscore section for the user to view. The user is able to cleat the highscore section if they are not satisfied with the score. If you do not answer the questions in time then the quiz will be over.
